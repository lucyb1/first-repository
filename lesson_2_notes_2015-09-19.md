### More Git
`~/.gitconfig` - all global Git settings - username, aliases,...

`~/.gitignore` - files not under VCS in any project

`git fetch` - get info from remote

`git diff` - show `diff` against last commit

`chmod a+r` - everyone can read

`ssh-add ~/.ssh/something` - tells to my ssh agent (ss keys manage daemon) that I want to use this identity as my key, ssh deamon remembers my password so I won't have to write it at every ssh connection

### Other

**.ini** - file format, as for example *.gitconfig*

`man ascii`: `\r` a `\n` is escape sequence for *one character*
